    <div class="description">
        <h2>Welcome to the 1920s!</h2>
       <p> In this game, you are a farmer living in 1920. 
        You had a good harvest last year, and between that and your savings you have $500 to invest in the stock market. </p>
        
      <p> Choose which stocks to buy and sell each year, and see if you can predict which companies are on their way up and who is about to crash. You can track your net worth with a line graph, and at the end print a report showing how you did.

    <h3>Buying on Margin</h3>
    <p>If you got a negative number for your amount left to spend, you've just bought stocks on margin! Buying on margin means you're borrowing money in order to buy stocks. If the stock price goes up, you can sell your stock and pay back your loan. But if the stock goes down, you might lose your <b>collateral</b>. Collateral is something you own - like a house or a car - that backs up your loan. If you can't repay your loan, the bank may take your collateral. For the purposes of this exercise, you are borrowing money against your farm. If you end the game in the negative, the bank will take your farm to pay off your loan!</p>
